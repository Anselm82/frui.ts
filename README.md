# Frui.ts

Frui.ts is a frontend framework using MVVM design pattern for clean separation of concerns and long-term maintainability.
It is built on top of the popular React library, using MobX and written in the modern TypeScript language.

Frui.ts allows ViewModel-first approach which enables automated testing of complex workflows on the ViewModel level with no need to simulate actual user interaction.
This framework is desing to support both small and large applications with SOLID codebase.

Frui.ts is UI framework agnostic - you can use it with any UI framework that supports React. It is also independent on backend or API structure, however, it brings some build-in support for REST API and Bootstrap.
