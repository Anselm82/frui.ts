# `@frui.ts/dataViews`

View components for data display

`DataRepeater` - generic structure for rendering data in a grid format. It supports sorting by column and custom value formatters as well.

`DataTable` - similar to DataRepeater, but renders ordinary html `<table>` by default.

## Styles

You can also use default CSS styles for table column headers supporting sorting:

```tsx
import "@frui.ts/dataviews/styles/sorting-header.scss";
```
