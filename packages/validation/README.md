# `@frui.ts/validation`

Validation is based on the idea that validation of a particular property of an entity (ie., the result of validation as a list of validation errors) can be handled as a computed value referring to the property and applying validation rule. Validator is thus just a factory that is able to generate such computed properties based on validation rules.
