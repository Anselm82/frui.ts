## View discovery

In order to support viewmodel-driven workflow, view discovery is an essential feature. This means that based on a particular view model instance, we should be able to find proper view and display it.

This feature consists of two parts - view registry that is a list of all available view models and their assigned views, and `View` component that makes the lookup and rendering.
