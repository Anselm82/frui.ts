# Frui.ts business overview

Nowadays, front-end applications are no longer just static websites with some JavaScript scripts used for simple validation or content animations - they are complex and business-critical applications that happened to run in a browser window. Therefore, front-end development requires the same effort in software architecture and quality control as any other part of the software solution.

We have built Frui.ts to bring development standards of backend or desktop applications to the dynamic field of HTML front-ends.

Frui.ts follows clean software architecture recommendations with a strong separation of concerns. Thus, the front-end application itself consists of multiple layers with clear responsibilities such as presentation layer, business logic layer, or data access layer. With that built-in the app from the beginning, our solutions are ready for long-term development and maintenance with no compromise of costs, initial setup, or development speed.

The presentation layer follows the Model-View-ViewModel pattern, which enables a clear distinction between the data and its actual visual representation. Two-way binding makes forms input, validation, and other data-related workflows implementation straightforward.

Our applications' inner structure follows the high-cohesion, loose coupling principle with dependency injection and message bus at its core.

The code is written in TypeScript, a modern, Microsoft-backed programming language with static typing, compile-time checks, and robust development tooling.
