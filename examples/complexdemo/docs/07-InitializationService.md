# Initialization service

Every application needs to intialize some internal services or load static data before it allows the user to interact. Let's create and start `InitializationService` that will be responsible for that.

`services/initializationService.ts`
```ts
TODO
```

Do not forget to register the service for DI container (or run the automatic generator).
