# Init the repo

    yarn init
    yarn create react-app complexdemo --template typescript

Delete the following files created by CRA because we will not need them:

 - src/App.css
 - src/App.test.tsx
 - src/App.tsx
 - src/index.css
 - src/logo.svg
 - src/App.tsx

It means that only `index.tsx`, `react-app-env.d.ts`, `serviceWorker.ts`, and `setupTests.ts` should remain in the `src` folder.

## Required packages

We will install these packages throughout the walkthrough, however, you can install them at once if you want to quickly start
